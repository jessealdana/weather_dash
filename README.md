# weather_dash
This app will allow the user to search the current weather in a city of their 
choosing.  It will additionally provide the five day forecast for that city via 
a second ajax call triggered by the same on-click event.

I worked with a TA on the forecast and it functioned well, however, I took it apart to add the current weather and broke both functions.
